 * Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
 * indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available
 * for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
 * <p>

 * for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
 * reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
 * <p>
 * 6. Chain of Authorship

 * Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
 * terms of this Licence.
 * <p>
 * 7. Disclaimer of Warranty
 * <p>
 * The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
 * Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
 * ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.
 * <p>
 * For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’
 * basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
 * without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
 * of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
 * rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

 * condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.
 * <p>
 * 8. Disclaimer of Liability
 * <p>
 * Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
 * persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
 * material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
 * use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
 * work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
 * damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
 * damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability
 * laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
 * <p>
 * 9. Additional agreements
 * <p>
 * While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
 * agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.
 * However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on
 * your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
 * Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
 * Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
 * such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional
 * liability.
 * <p>

 * The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I
 * agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence

 * <p>
 * Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
 * agreement between the Parties as to the Work.
 * <p>
 * If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable

 * whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
 * valid and enforceable.
 * <p>
 * The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions
 * of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required

 * Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
 * of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty
 * on the Functioning of the European Union,
